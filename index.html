<h2>The Story: How did Sophie and Janelle become friends??</h2>
Well, it all started in Kindergarden. We were having lunch with Mrs. Hamilton. It was the only seat left so, Janelle sat next to Sophie. Everyone else was talking except for Sophie and Janelle. So, Sophie made an attempt to talk to Janelle.<br>
<br>
"Hi! What's your name?" She said.<br>
"Janelle. What's yours?" Janelle asked.<br>
"Sophie. Do you have any friends?" She asked.<br>
"No. I'm new. I had to rush to get ready for Kindergarten because in Pre-K 4 I has always in the afternoon class." Janelle Said.<br>
"OH. OK. What do you like?" Asked Sophie.<br>
"I like Candy, Pizza, TV's, I even have a Roblox account!" Said Janelle.<br>
"I like Miraculous." Said Sophie.<br>
"OOH! You mean the one on Netflix? I finished that!" Said Janelle.<br>
"Yes! Want to play with me during recess?" Asked Sophie<br>
"Yay!!!" Screamed Janelle.<br>
<br>


And they've been friends ever since.
